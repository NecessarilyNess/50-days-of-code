    <h1>Day 4 - About me</h1>
    <p> My name is Vanessa and I am a Mathematics student. I care a lot about a bunch of things 
        and so I do a lot of stuff.
    </p>
    <h2>Things that I care about</h2>
    <p>This is a list of some of the things that I care about</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Black Lives Matter</li>
        <li>Diversity in STEM</li>
        <li>Curly Hair</li>
        <li>Proving to myself that technology isn't that scary</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Black Lives Matter</h3>

    <p>
        I am half black. I care a lot about the Black Lives Matter movement
        and I am currently writing a report about the findings of my survey
        called Black Lives Matter on campus too.
    </p>

    <h3>Diveristy in STEM</h3>

    <p>
        I care about this a lot, particularly Women in STEM.
    </p>
    <h3>Curly Hair</h3>

    <p>
        I have curly hair with many different types in it and so I 
        have to know how to take care of a few different types of curls.
        I have 3b, 3c and a little bit of 4a hair. 
    </p>

    <h3> Proving to myself that technology isn't that scary </h3>
    <p> 
        I have been scared of this stuff for a long while and so it is high time 
        that I get over it and get comfortable which is what I'm doing.
        Right now, most of my experience is in Python for mathematical computation 
        but now I want to understand how everything fits together.
    </p>
    <p> Right now, I am familiar with these languages</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>R</li>
        <li>MATLAB</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        But I want to get better at the web development langauges in particular.
    </p>
