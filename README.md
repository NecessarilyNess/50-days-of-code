# 50-days-of-code

This is my playground for my 50 days of code. Over the next 50 days I plan to get better at 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript and of course Git.

So far in this repo, there is my work for the following courses:
- Learning react.js (LinkedIn Learning)
- React.js: Building an Interface (LinkedIn Learning)
- Bootstrap 4: Essential Training (LinkedIn Learning)
